## Fine-tuning reproduciblity of LIGO Black Hole signal tutorial, Part II

**Note:** This repository is public so that Binder can find it. All code and data is based on the original [LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository](https://github.com/losc-tutorial/LOSC_Event_tutorial). This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility, as a homework assignment for the [Spring 2022 installment of UC Berkeley's Stat 159/259 course, _Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_](https://ucb-stat-159-s22.github.io). Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.

#### Make Commands

- `env`: creates and configures the environment.
- `html`: build the JupyterBook normally (calling jupyterbook build .). Note this build can only be viewed if the repo is cloned locally, or with the VNC desktop on the hub.
- `html-hub`: build the JupyterBook so that you can view it on the hub with the URL proxy trick as indicated above.
- `clean`: clean up the figures, audio and _build folders.
- `all`: run `index.ipynb`
